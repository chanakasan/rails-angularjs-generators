Description:
    Generates an angular app for doing basic crud operations.
    Pass the model name, either CamelCased or under_scored. The angular app
    name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model name.

    This generates an angular app in app/assets/javascripts/src/<app-name>/main.js

Example:
    `rails generate angularjs_crud Article`
